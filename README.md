# Analysing human behaviour and their trajectories in space from a social perspective
 
Repository containing the work in progress for the project __Detecting Socially Occupied Spaces__ at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/).

## Goal
This research aims to design a technological solution to interpret the socially occupied space automatically by using depth cameras.
